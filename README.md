## Author

This project is created by [Fox](https://x.com/indie_maker_fox), the founder of [WorkflowLab](https://workflowlab.com) and [Mkdirs](https://mkdirs.com). The official X account for [WorkflowLab](https://workflowlab.com) is [@workflowlabcom](https://x.com/workflowlabcom), you can follow this account for the updates about WorkflowLab.

## Documentation

The documentation is available on the [website](https://workflowlab.com/docs). It includes guides, tutorials, and detailed explanations of the code. I designed it to be as beginner-friendly as possible, so you can start making money from day one.

If you found anything that could be improved, please let me know.

## Strapi CMS Integration

This version of WorkflowLab has been modified to use Strapi as a headless CMS for managing content. The project now includes:

- A Strapi CMS instance in the `strapi-cms` directory
- Pre-configured content types for Software SaaS listings and Blog Posts
- Environment variables for connecting to Strapi from the Next.js frontend
- Scripts to run both Next.js and Strapi concurrently

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the Strapi CMS, please refer to [strapi-cms/README.md](strapi-cms/README.md).
