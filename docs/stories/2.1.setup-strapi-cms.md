## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
Based on a typical Strapi setup, the project structure would include:
- `config/` - Configuration files for database, server, and admin panel
- `src/admin/` - Admin panel customization
- `src/api/` - Content types and API endpoints
- `src/components/` - Reusable component definitions
- `public/` - Publicly accessible files
- `database/` - Database migration and schema files

### Testing
- Verify Strapi installation and initial setup
- Test database connection and schema creation
- Validate admin panel accessibility
- Test API endpoint security
- Ensure development environment allows concurrent Next.js and Strapi execution
- Document testing procedures for Strapi functionality
