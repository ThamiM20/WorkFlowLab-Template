## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
Based on the architecture document, the key areas for development environment setup would be:
- `app/` - Main application directory for Next.js pages and routes
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `lib/` - Utility functions and services
- `public/` - Static assets
- `services/` - API service integrations
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

### Testing
- Verify development server starts without errors
- Test that basic site functionality works
- Ensure all required dependencies are properly installed
- Validate that the development workflow is clear and repeatable
- Test that both Next.js and Strapi can run simultaneously
