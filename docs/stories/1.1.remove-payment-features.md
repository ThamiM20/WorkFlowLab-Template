4. All payment-related API endpoints and services are removed
5. The development server starts successfully without any payment-related errors
6. User authentication functionality (for admin access) is retained where needed
7. Basic site structure (landing page, navigation) remains functional

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
Based on the architecture document, the payment-related features would likely be in these locations:
- `components/` - Payment components (to be removed)
- `app/` - Payment pages (to be removed)
- `app/api/` - Payment API endpoints (to be removed)
- `services/` - Payment services (to be removed)
- `lib/` - Payment utilities (to be removed)

### Testing
- Unit tests for removed components should be deleted
- Integration tests for payment endpoints should be removed
- E2E tests that involve payment flows should be removed or modified
- Test file location: `__tests__/` directory
- Test standards: Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- Testing frameworks: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
