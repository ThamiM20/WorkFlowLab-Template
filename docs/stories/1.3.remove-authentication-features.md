# Story 1.3: Remove Authentication Features

## Status

**so that** I can easily browse the software catalog and read blog posts without any barriers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All login/sign-up buttons are removed from the user interface
2. User profile functionality is removed from the navigation
3. Any pages requiring authentication are either removed or made publicly accessible
4. The website can be fully navigated without any authentication requirements
5. Content remains accessible to all users without login
