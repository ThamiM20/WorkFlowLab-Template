# Story 3.1: Integrate Next.js Frontend with Strapi CMS

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to integrate the Next.js frontend with the Strapi CMS,
**so that** the website can dynamically display content managed in Strapi.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js application can successfully connect to Strapi API endpoints
2. API calls are properly secured and handle errors gracefully
3. Content from Strapi is correctly fetched and displayed in the frontend
4. Caching mechanisms are implemented for optimal performance
5. Development environment supports previewing content from Strapi
6. Environment variables are properly configured for different environments
7. Data fetching follows best practices for Next.js applications

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Configure API connection (AC: #1)
  - [ ] Set up Strapi API client in Next.js
  - [ ] Configure API endpoints URLs
  - [ ] Test basic connectivity to Strapi
- [ ] Implement secure API calls (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Handle authentication for API requests
  - [ ] Implement error handling for API calls
  - [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed requests
- [ ] Fetch and display content (AC: #3)
  - [ ] Create service functions to fetch Strapi data
  - [ ] Implement data display in components
  - [ ] Test content rendering
- [ ] Implement caching (AC: #4)
  - [ ] Configure caching for API responses
  - [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategies
  - [ ] Test caching performance improvements
- [ ] Set up development preview (AC: #5)
  - [ ] Configure preview mode in Next.js
  - [ ] Test content preview functionality
  - [ ] Document preview workflow
- [ ] Configure environment variables (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Set up environment-specific API URLs
  - [ ] Configure authentication tokens
  - [ ] Test environment configurations
- [ ] Follow Next.js best practices (AC: #7)
  - [ ] Implement proper data fetching patterns
  - [ ] Use SSR/SSG where appropriate
  - [ ] Optimize for performance

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
Based on the Next.js architecture:
- `lib/` - Utility functions and API clients
- `services/` - Data fetching services
- `app/` - Pages and layouts that will display Strapi content
- `components/` - Reusable components for displaying content
- `env.local` - Environment variables for local development

### Testing
- Test API connectivity from Next.js to Strapi
- Verify authentication and authorization for API calls
- Test error handling scenarios
- Validate caching implementation
- Test content rendering in different components
- Verify preview functionality works correctly
- Test different environment configurations
- Ensure performance optimizations are effective
