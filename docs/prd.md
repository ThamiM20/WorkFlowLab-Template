# SaaS Template for Content-Rich Marketing Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

* Rapidly build a content-rich marketing platform by repurposing the SaaS template's core functionality
* Showcase a curated catalog of software products (Software SaaS content type) as a discovery and review platform
* Separate content management from development by integrating Strapi as a headless CMS
* Establish a foundation for organic growth with SEO optimization and content marketing focus

### Background Context

This project involves repurposing a SaaS template to create a professional, content-driven website that serves as both a software catalog and a blog platform. Rather than functioning as a traditional SaaS with subscriptions and payments, this implementation focuses on content marketing and SEO. 

<!-- The template provides the foundational structure (landing page, blog, user auth) which is customized for a new purpose. By integrating Strapi as a headless CMS, non-technical content administrators can manage both the software catalog and blog content easily without needing developer intervention for every update. This approach ployment of a high-quality, functional marketing and catalog website, allowing the team to focus immediately on content creation and promotion. -->
